### Organização e explicação do código:

- In the start we thought it would be hard to do the work if we woul not use the Diccionary option in Python to define the many variables of the characters . So we reaserched how it worked and how it would improve the work. 

- In the start, we implemented the turn order. We assigned a value to each distinct character and added a random number between 1 and 20 (our dice). The character that had the highest number would go inthe first turn and etc.

- The enemy characters or troops are a "Goblin Shaman", a "Goblin" and an "Ogre". In contrast the allied troops are the "Priest", the "Rougue" and the "Warrior". Each chjaracter that the player can control posses special and unique spells, while in the enemy squad only the "goblin Shaman" can cast a spell. Non the less The enemy squad is full of surprises. 

 - Every Troop can do an basic attack that will inflict direct damage onthe target and also every character canj use the action "Rest" wich will make the character loose the round but restore some of the missing mana.
